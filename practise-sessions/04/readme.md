You can get up to 15 points from the files:

* 01\_introduction\_to\_the\_family\_of\_normal\_distributions.ipynb* 02\_image\_processing\_with\_random\_markov\_fields.ipynb* 03\_gibbs\_sampler\_for\_normal\_distributions.ipynb* 04\_markov\_chains\_with\_continous\_state\_space.ipynb* 05\_hidden\_markov\_models\_with\_continous\_state\_space.ipynb

I suggest that you at least try to do some exercises about Gibbs sampling or sequance maodels with continious state space.
