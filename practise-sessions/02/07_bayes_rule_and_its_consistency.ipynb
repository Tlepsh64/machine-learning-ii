    "Bayesianist interpret probabilities as subjective opinions that depend on the background knowledge. As such the question whether statistical inference produces results that are consistent with other theories is ill-posed -- if a person does not belive base results of a theory his or her posterior does not have match the predictions of the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the inference must still adhere internal consistence. That is, we should always get the same results, if we rephrase the problem in different but equivalent ways. Next examples about coinflipping show that the Bayes theorem satisfies restriction. "
