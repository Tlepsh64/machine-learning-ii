# Supporting materials

* Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani:
**An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R**. 
 * **Chapter Statistical learning**  gives a good overview about regression and classification tasks and introduces performance metrics. 
 * **Chapter Resampling Methods** gives a good overview about crossvalidation and bootstrap methods.   

* Yves Grandvalet: **Hypothesis Testing for Cross-Validation**
  * Contains the formula for the crossvalidation error variance. This is one of the rare articles that provides a relevant and informative result.  

* Tom Augspurger: **Effective Pandas**
  * Shows the modern way to build data processing pipelines with Pandas
  * Shows how to prepare the data for analysis (tidy data)   

* There is no nice material that describes the performance of the machine learning methods as a function of dataset size. You can look for any book that talks about statistical learning theory. However, the results are very technical and usually too week in practice. They capture only the intuition.
